# The Grape Programming Language

This is a rewrite of the Python interpreter of the Grape Programming Language. It is
designed to be able to compile to native code using [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org).

Having a *compiled* interpreter should be A LOT quicker than an interpreter in
*interpreted* python ;)
